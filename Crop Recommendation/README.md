# Exploratory Data Analysis For Heart Disease
I have perform EDA on crop recommendation dataset to understand each features and their relation with each other as well as with the target feature.


# Dataset Information
Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.This dataset was build by augmenting datasets of rainfall, climate and fertilizer data available for India.
